<!-- this is a subheadline -->
Thanks for stopping by!

Iâ€™m a postdoctoral teaching and learning fellow scientist working in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. My past research interests included ecotoxicology, specializing in Pesticide Risk Assessment where I used a model to simulate the environmental fate of pesticides.  

In order to address the challenges of my pH.D. I got very involved in programming. Along the way I realized the importance of high quality software development and databases, even more when model results pretend to be use for decision making. That is why, in recent years my main interests have been code reproducibility, generation of dashboards, and software development.
