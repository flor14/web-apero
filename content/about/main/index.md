  In the [Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) I have the opportunity to explore different technologies and teach to a diverse group of students from all over the world. My long-standing passion for multidisciplinary education prompted me to complement my teaching studies with the inquiry into specific didactics of programming in different courses. I have been active in organizational and mentorship capacities for tech communities, such as [ReproHack](https://www.reprohack.org/) and [R-Ladies global](https://rladies.org/).
