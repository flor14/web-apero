intro: In the Master of Data Science program I have the oportunity to explore and compare different technologies and teach to a diverse group of students from all over the world. My long-standing appreciation for education led me to a teaching degree in Biology at the University the Buenos Aires that I complemented with the study of specific didactics of programming in different courses.
