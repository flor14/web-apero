My field of work has been ecotoxicology, specializing in Pesticide Risk Assessment. I studied at the University of Buenos Aires where I obtained my Bachelor's, and Doctorate in Biology. During my PhD, I worked with multiple databases and used a model to simulate the environmental fate of pesticides. 

I have a teaching degree at the University the Buenos Aires. She has been an instructor for The Carpentries and is an RStudio Certified Trainer for Tidyverse and Shiny.
